# Hindi-Library-Management-System
Full Stack Project with CRUD operations and Asynchronous fields using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, AJAX, Bootstrap and Xampp

To use the application in localhost: 
1. install xampp or wamp.
2. start mysql server.
3. open phpmyadmin.
4. create a new database called 'lms'.
5. import sql dump file.
6. start the apache server.
7. now write: "localhost/HLMS/index.php" to visit the home page of the app.

Have used php security code to avoid directing to an admin page before login.
